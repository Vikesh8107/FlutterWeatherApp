# Weather Forecast App

## Overview

This Flutter project is a simple weather forecast application that utilizes a mock REST API to fetch and display weather data for the present day and the next 5 days. The app is designed to showcase basic Flutter development skills, including API integration, error handling, and UI implementation.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure that you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set up your development environment.

## Implementation Details

### API Integration

The app uses the http package to simulate API requests. The API endpoint is a mock service that provides weather data for the specified location.



### UI Design

The UI displays weather details for the present day and the next 7 days. It includes temperature, condition, humidity, and other relevant information. A loading indicator is shown while fetching data, and error messages are displayed for unsuccessful API requests or invalid responses.
